    <h2>Using Google Analytics</h2>
    <h3>Type and purpose of the processing</h3>
    <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain

        stored on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the
        cookie about your use of this website is typically transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there.
        However, due to the activation of IP anonymisation on these websites, your IP address will be truncated
        beforehand by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the
        Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google
        server in the U.S. and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this
        information to evaluate your use of the website, summarise reports on website activities and provide other
        services related to website and Internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transferred from your
        browser as part of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p>

    <p>Google processes your data in the United States of America and is subject to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: <a

    <h3>Mandatory or required provision</h3>
    <p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary, based solely on your consent. If you prevent access, this can
        lead to functional limitations on the website.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of consent</h3>
    <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting in your browser software; however, please note
        that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website in their entirety. Furthermore,
        you can prevent the collected data generated by the cookie and the data related to your use of the website
        (including your IP address) being transmitted to Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by
        downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a
            href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics</a>.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, or as an alternative to the browser add-on, you can prevent tracking by Google Analytics on our web
        pages <a title="Google Analytics Opt-Out-Cookie setzen"
            onClick="gaOptout();alert('Google Analytics is deactivated');" href="#">by clicking this link</a>, which
        will install an opt-out cookie on your device. This will prevent data collection by Google Analytics for this
        website and for this browser in the future, as long as the cookie remains installed in your browser.</p>
    <h3>Profiling</h3>
    <p>With the assistance of the tracking tool Google Analytics, the browsing behaviour of the website visitors can be
        evaluated and their respective interests can be analysed. For this analysis, we create a pseudonymous user
        profile.</p>

    <h2>Using script libraries (Google Webfonts)</h2>
    <h3>Type and purpose of the processing</h3>
    <p>In order to present our content correctly and graphically appealing across all browsers, we use ‘Google Webfonts’
        from Google LLC (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, hereinafter ‘Google’) to display fonts
        on this website.</p>
    <p>You’ll find the data protection guidelines of the library operator Google here: <a

        (Art. 6 Para. 1 (a) GDPR).</p>
    <h3>Recipients</h3>
    <p>The use of script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection to the operator of the library.
        It is theoretically possible – but currently also unclear whether and to what end – that the operator, in this
        case Google, will collect data.</p>
    <h3>Retention period</h3>
    <p>We do not collect any personal data via the integration of Google Webfonts.</p>
    <p>You’ll find additional information on Google Webfonts at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq"

    <h3>Mandatory or required provision</h3>

        presentation of standard-fonts content is not possible without this provision.</p>

    <p>If you do not want this assignment in your Google profile, you must log out of Google before activating the
        button. Google stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for advertising, market research and/or
